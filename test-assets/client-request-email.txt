Hi Team,

Following up on our call yesterday. The executive team has finalized the Q1 priorities
and we need to move fast on these:

1. URGENT (by Jan 25): Fix the dashboard loading issue. Users are complaining about
   15+ second load times. This is affecting our NPS score.

2. HIGH PRIORITY (by Feb 1): Implement SSO integration with Okta. Our IT department
   mandates this for all vendor tools. Contact mike.chen@bigcorp.com for the technical
   specs.

3. MEDIUM (by Feb 15): Add export to PDF functionality for reports. Marketing needs
   this for board presentations. They specifically want:
   - Company logo in header
   - Custom date range selection
   - Graphs should be included
   - File size under 5MB

4. LOW (Q1 sometime): Dark mode toggle. The dev team keeps asking for this :)

Budget: We have $50,000 approved for Q1 enhancements.

Can you please provide:
a) Time estimates for each item
b) Proposed implementation order
c) Any concerns or blockers
d) A project plan we can share with stakeholders

Let's schedule a kickoff call for early next week. I'm free Tuesday 2-4pm or
Thursday morning.

Best regards,
Jennifer Smith
VP of Operations, BigCorp Inc.
